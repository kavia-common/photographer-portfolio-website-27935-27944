This folder contains top-level pages for the React app.

- Home.jsx renders the converted static layout from assets/index.html.
- Images are referenced via /assets/... and are served from public/assets.
- Global styles are imported at src/index.js from ../../assets/styles.css and also made available as /assets/styles.css in public for direct linking if needed.
